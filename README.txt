===========================

Stuff works similar to NDS homebrew projects.
Code goes in source/
Data goes in data/

Place a NSMB USA ROM in this folder (Other regions will NOT work)
Use a recent version of NSMB Editor to compile and insert the code into the ROM.

Included features:

nsmb.h - Defines several useful functions from the game. Not complete at all, I've just added stuff as I needed it.

Enjoy!
